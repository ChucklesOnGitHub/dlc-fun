Adapted from the example here: https://alexemg.github.io/DLC-Cajal-Course/content/Day3_DLClive.html

Using a webcam, move one wrist up and down to control sound frequency (pitch) and the other left and right to control sound amplitude (volume).
On a CPU this has a few seconds lag but it makes making melodies with your body even more fun :D
